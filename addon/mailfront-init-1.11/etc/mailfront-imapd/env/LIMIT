# This feature is used as an additional safety check that should stop
# any potential denial-of-service attacks that exploit any kind of
# a memory leak to exhaust all the available memory on the server.
# It is theoretically possible that obscenely huge folders will also
# result in the server running out of memory when doing server-side
# sorting (by my calculations you have to have at least 100,000 messages
# in a single folder, for that to happen).
