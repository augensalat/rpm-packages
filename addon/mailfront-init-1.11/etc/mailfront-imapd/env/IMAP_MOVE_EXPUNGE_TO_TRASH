# Set IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH to move expunged messages to Trash.  This
# effectively allows an undo of message deletion by fishing the deleted
# mail from trash.  Trash can be manually expunged as usually, and mail
# will get automatically expunged from Trash according to IMAP_EMPTYTRASH.
#
# NOTE: shared folders are still expunged as usual.  Shared folders are
# not affected.
