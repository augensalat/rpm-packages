# Set IMAP_DISABLETHREADSORT to disable the THREAD and SORT commands -
# server side sorting and threading.
#
# Those capabilities will still be advertised, but the server will reject
# them.  Set this option if you want to disable all the extra load from
# server-side threading and sorting.  Not advertising those capabilities
# will simply result in the clients reading the entire folder, and sorting
# it on the client side.  That will still put some load on the server.
# advertising these capabilities, but rejecting the commands, will stop this
# silliness.
