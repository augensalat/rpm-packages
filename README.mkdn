openSUSE RPM Packages
=====================

This is a collection of RPM SPEC files of server software packages
I use on a couple of systems.

The actual software packages are not included, you can find their URLs
inside the SPEC files. For a couple of packages I added a runtime
environment, that is found in the `addon` directory.

Whenever possible daemons run as supervised processes under [daemonstools][].
